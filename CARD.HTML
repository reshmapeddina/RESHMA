Ships were anchored at open roads and were loaded with cargo transported from Visakhapatnam shore by means of small Masula boats. A reference to Vizagapatam merchant is available in the inscriptions of Sri Bheemeswara Swamy temple (1068 AD), East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh. During 12th century AD, Vizagapatam was a fortified merchandize town managed by a guild.[25] The city's control was alternating between the Chola dynasty and the Gajapati Kingdom in 11th and 12th centuries,[26][27] until its conquest by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.[24]</p>
